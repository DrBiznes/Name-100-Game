# About Name100Women

Welcome to Name100Women, a unique challenge that tests your knowledge of influential women throughout history. This project was born from a simple yet powerful idea: to celebrate and remember the countless women who have shaped our world.

## The Challenge

The challenge is straightforward: name 100 women in 15 minutes. While it might sound simple, this task reveals interesting patterns in how we remember and recognize women's contributions to society. Some key aspects of the challenge include:

- No restrictions on time period or field
- Names can be from any country or culture
- Both historical and contemporary figures are valid
- Fictional characters are not accepted

## Why This Matters

In a world where women's achievements have often been overlooked or underrepresented, this challenge serves multiple purposes:

1. **Awareness**: It helps us realize how many (or how few) women we can readily name
2. **Education**: It encourages learning about women's contributions across different fields
3. **Recognition**: It promotes the acknowledgment of women's achievements throughout history
4. **Discussion**: It sparks conversations about representation and historical documentation

## How It Works

The game mechanics are designed to be simple and engaging:

1. Start the timer
2. Type in names of women
3. The system will validate each entry
4. Try to reach 100 before time runs out

### Scoring System

Your final score is calculated based on:

- Number of correct names
- Time taken
- Uniqueness of names (compared to other players)

## Technical Implementation

This project is built using modern web technologies:

- React for the frontend
- TailwindCSS for styling
- MDX for content management
- Local storage for game state
- Custom validation system

## Future Plans

We're constantly working to improve the game. Some planned features include:

- Educational resources about each woman
- Categories and themes
- Multiplayer mode
- Historical statistics and trends
