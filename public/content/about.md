# About Name100Women

## Introduction

Name100Women is a unique challenge that tests your knowledge of influential women throughout history. This game was created to celebrate and promote awareness of women's contributions to various fields including science, arts, politics, and social justice.

## How It Started

The inspiration for Name100Women came from a simple observation: while many people can name numerous male historical figures, they often struggle to name an equivalent number of women[^1]. This game aims to change that by making learning about historical women engaging and fun.

### Frontend Stack
- React for the UI
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling

- Score verification

## Community Impact

Since its launch, Name100Women has helped thousands of players discover and learn about influential women throughout history[^3]. The game has been used in educational settings and has sparked meaningful discussions about women's contributions to society.

## Future Plans
