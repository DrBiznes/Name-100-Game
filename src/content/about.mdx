# About Name100Women

Welcome to Name100Women, a unique challenge that tests your knowledge of influential women throughout history. This project was born from a simple yet powerful idea: to celebrate and remember the countless women who have shaped our world.

## The Challenge

The challenge is straightforward: name 100 women in 15 minutes. While it might sound simple, this task reveals interesting patterns in how we remember and recognize women's contributions to society. Some key aspects of the challenge include:

- No restrictions on time period or field
- Names can be from any country or culture
- Both historical and contemporary figures are valid
- Fictional characters are not accepted

## Why This Matters

In a world where women's achievements have often been overlooked or underrepresented, this challenge serves multiple purposes:

1. **Awareness**: It helps us realize how many (or how few) women we can readily name
2. **Education**: It encourages learning about women's contributions across different fields
3. **Recognition**: It promotes the acknowledgment of women's achievements throughout history
4. **Discussion**: It sparks conversations about representation and historical documentation

## How It Works

The game mechanics are designed to be simple and engaging. Here's a look at the core game loop:

<CodeBlock title="Game Loop Implementation" language="typescript">{`
const gameLoop = {
  timeLimit: 15 * 60, // 15 minutes in seconds
  targetNames: 100,
  validateName: async (name: string) => {
    // Check local database first
    if (await checkLocalDatabase(name)) {
      return true;
    }
    
    // Fall back to Wikipedia API
    return await checkWikipediaForWoman(name);
  },
  calculateScore: (names: string[], timeRemaining: number) => {
    return {
      namesCount: names.length,
      timeBonus: timeRemaining > 0 ? timeRemaining * 10 : 0,
      uniqueBonus: calculateUniqueBonus(names),
      total: names.length * 100 + (timeRemaining > 0 ? timeRemaining * 10 : 0)
    };
  }
};
`}</CodeBlock>

### Scoring System

Your final score is calculated based on several factors:

<CodeBlock title="Score Calculation" language="typescript">{`
function calculateScore(submission: GameSubmission): Score {
  const baseScore = submission.validNames.length * 100;
  const timeBonus = Math.max(0, submission.timeRemaining) * 10;
  const uniqueBonus = submission.validNames
    .filter(name => isUniqueName(name))
    .length * 50;

  return {
    base: baseScore,
    timeBonus,
    uniqueBonus,
    total: baseScore + timeBonus + uniqueBonus
  };
}
`}</CodeBlock>

## Technical Implementation

This project is built using modern web technologies. Here's how we handle name validation:

<CodeBlock title="Name Validation System" language="typescript">{`
async function validateName(name: string): Promise<ValidationResult> {
  // Normalize the name for comparison
  const normalized = name
    .toLowerCase()
    .normalize("NFD")
    .replace(/[\u0300-\u036f]/g, "")  // Remove diacritics
    .trim();

  // Check against our local database first
  const localResult = await checkLocalDatabase(normalized);
  if (localResult.isValid) {
    return {
      isValid: true,
      name: localResult.canonicalName,
      source: 'local'
    };
  }

  // Fall back to Wikipedia API
  const wikiResult = await checkWikipedia(normalized);
  if (wikiResult.isValid) {
    // Cache the result for future use
    await cacheValidName(wikiResult.canonicalName);
    return {
      isValid: true,
      name: wikiResult.canonicalName,
      source: 'wikipedia'
    };
  }

  return {
    isValid: false,
    error: 'Name not found or not verified as a woman'
  };
}
`}</CodeBlock>

## Future Plans

We're constantly working to improve the game. Some planned features include:

- Educational resources about each woman
- Categories and themes
- Multiplayer mode
- Historical statistics and trends
