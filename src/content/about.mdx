In early 2024, a simple challenge emerged that would expose an unsurprising gap in humanities collective knowledge: Name 100 women. [NorthernLion's attempt](https://youtu.be/SqLEGFqgRfc?si=rpo2DjbnEuJoXr-7) at this challenge inspired me to create this game, as an excerise in creating a backend api for the first time! <Note number={1}>This challenge originated from Twitch streamer QTCinderella in early 2024, after Obama's wife asked me to name 100 women.</Note>

SILLY ROBOT SAY TASK IMPOSSIBLE BUT APE KNOW BETTER!! APE NO NEED NAME ALL WOMEN, APE JUST NEED HELP HUMANS REMEMBER 100 AMAZING WOMEN!! APE MAKE GAME TO SHOW HUMANS CAN DO IT!! ü¶ç

## The Challenges

APE FACE BIG PROBLEMS WHEN MAKE GAME!! APE NEED:

APE need check names FAST and GOOD!! not easy because names come from ALL OVER WORLD and ALL TIME PERIODS!! sometimes wikipedia say NO MORE API CALLS so APE need be SMART with cache!! 

some humans have WEIRD names like "Madonna" or "Cher" but APE handle this good!! APE also need figure out if human is woman when wikipedia page not clear!!

APE SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS BECAUSE APE STRONG!! ü¶ç

Sorry an ape keeps taking my keyboard. Anyways, to solve these problems, I developed a validation flow that combines local databases, name normalization, an da wikipedia api to check names good!!

<ValidationFlowChart />

### Challenge 1: Verification Vanessa

Validating various versions of voluminous names ventured through three vital layers: <Note number={2}>Each layer of verification adds both accuracy and complexity, requiring careful balance between speed and correctness.</Note>

Validating various versions of voluminous names needed novel solutions - we're talking millions of magnificent monikers! The solution? A multi-layered verification system that gets progressively more precise (and computationally powerful) as needed.

1. **Local Database Lookup**: Lightning fast, no API calls needed
2. **Wikipedia API Verification**: For names not in our database
3. **Special Case Handling**: For those tricky edge cases that break all the rules

Here's how the core validation pipeline works:

<CodeBlock title="Name Normalization" language="typescript">{`// From nameValidationService.ts
function normalizeNameForComparison(name: string): string {
  return name
    .toLowerCase()
    .normalize("NFD")
    .replace(/[\u0300-\u036f]/g, "")  // Remove diacritics
    .replace(/-/g, ' ')               // Replace hyphens with spaces
    .replace(/\./g, '')              // Remove periods
    .trim();                          // Remove leading/trailing whitespace
}`}</CodeBlock>

This normalization is crucial - it handles everything from diacritics to hyphenated names. <Note number={3}>Name normalization is the unsung hero of the validation system, handling countless edge cases before they become problems.</Note>

### Challenge 2: Mononym Mary

Managing mysterious mononyms meant mastering multiple methods of name validation. The perplexing problem presented itself when players proposed peculiar patterns - particularly powerful performers like "Cher". <Note number={4}>Mononyms presented a unique challenge, as they break the traditional FirstName LastName pattern but are still valid entries.</Note>

My meticulous matching mechanism initially marked these magnificent monikers as mistakes since they didn't follow the familiar "FirstName LastName" format. The solution? A sophisticated system of staged scanning:

<CodeBlock title="Complete Mononym Validation System" language="typescript">{`// From nameValidationService.ts
// Get list of valid mononyms from database
function getValidMononyms(): Set<string> {
  return new Set(
    names
      .filter(name => !name.includes(' '))  // Get only single-word names
      .map(name => normalizeNameForComparison(name))
  );
}

// Check if input is likely just a first name
function isValidSingleName(name: string): boolean {
  // Split the name and check if it's just one word
  const nameParts = name.trim().split(/\s+/);
  if (nameParts.length !== 1) {
    return true; // If it's more than one word, it's valid
  }

  // Common name prefixes that might indicate a stage name
  const artistPrefixes = ['dj', 'mc', 'dr', 'h.e.r'];
  const normalizedName = normalizeNameForComparison(name);
  
  // If the name has any of these prefixes, it's likely a stage name
  if (artistPrefixes.some(prefix => normalizedName.startsWith(prefix))) {
    return true;
  }

  // Check against our database of valid mononyms
  const validMononyms = getValidMononyms();
  return validMononyms.has(normalizedName);
}`}</CodeBlock>

But that's just the first layer. When we hit Wikipedia, we need even more sophisticated mononym detection: <Note number={5}>Stage names and mononyms often require additional context from Wikipedia articles to validate properly.</Note>

This two-layer approach helps catch both common and edge cases: The system first checks against known mononyms, then falls back to contextual clues in Wikipedia articles.

### Challenge 3: Wiki Winona

APE FACE BIGGEST BOSS BATTLE: WIKIPEDIA!! APE NEED CHECK MANY NAMES FAST BUT WIKIPEDIA SOMETIMES SAY "NO MORE CALLS APE!!" ü¶ç <Note number={6}>APE PROCESS OVER one million WIKI CALLS EVERY DAY!! APE NEED BE SMART WITH CACHE AND API LIMITS OR WIKIPEDIA GET ANGRY!!</Note>

APE SOLVE PROBLEM WITH THREE SMART MOVES:
1. APE CHECK LOCAL DATABASE FIRST (SUPER FAST!!)
2. APE USE SMART CACHE SO NO ASK WIKIPEDIA SAME THING TWICE
3. APE READ WIKIPEDIA PAGE LIKE DETECTIVE!! LOOK FOR SPECIAL WORDS THAT TELL IF PERSON IS WOMAN!!

when APE find new name, APE do special dance:
- first check if name in APE memory
- then look at wikipedia but BE GENTLE
- use smart word finding to know if person woman
- save result in cache so next time ZOOM FAST!!

APE SYSTEM WORK SO GOOD NOW!! PROCESS THOUSANDS OF NAMES AND NEVER MAKE WIKIPEDIA MAD!! ü¶ç

Here's the complete verification process:
layered
<CodeBlock title="Complete Wikipedia and Gender Verification" language="typescript">{`export async function checkWikipedia(name: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // First check local database - we know these are all women
  if (checkLocalDatabase(name)) {
    return true;
  }

  // Reject invalid single names before making API call
  if (!isValidSingleName(name)) {
    return false;
  }

  try {
    const normalizedName = name.toLowerCase().normalize("NFD")
      .replace(/[\u0300-\u036f]/g, "")
      .replace(/-/g, ' ');

    const searchUrl = \`https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=search&srsearch="\${encodeURIComponent(name)}"&format=json&origin=*\`;
    const searchResponse = await fetch(searchUrl);
    const searchData = await searchResponse.json();

    if (searchData.query.search.length === 0) {
      return false;
    }

    for (let result of searchData.query.search) {
      const normalizedTitle = result.title.toLowerCase()
        .normalize("NFD")
        .replace(/[\u0300-\u036f]/g, "")
        .replace(/-/g, ' ');
      
      if (!normalizedTitle.includes(normalizedName)) {
        continue;
      }

      const pageId = result.pageid;
      const contentUrl = \`https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&exintro&pageids=\${pageId}&format=json&origin=*\`;
      const contentResponse = await fetch(contentUrl);
      const contentData = await contentResponse.json();

      const page = contentData.query.pages[pageId];
      const intro = page.extract || '';

      // Handle mononyms/stage names first
      if (name.trim().split(/\s+/).length === 1) {
        const mononymIndicators = [
          'stage name', 'mononym', 'professional name', 'known professionally',
          'stage persona', 'performing name', 'artistic name', 'pseudonym',
          'singer', 'artist', 'performer', 'musician', 'actress', 'known as'
        ];
        const hasMononymIndicator = mononymIndicators.some(indicator => 
          intro.toLowerCase().includes(indicator)
        );
        
        if (!hasMononymIndicator) {
          continue; // Skip this result if it doesn't indicate a stage name/mononym
        }
      }

      // This is where the gender verification happens
      const plainText = intro.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '');
      const femaleIndicators = [
        'she', 'her', 'hers', 'woman', 'female', 'girl', 'actress',
        'chairwoman', 'congresswoman', 'businesswoman', 'feminist',
        'spokeswoman', 'singer', 'performer'
      ];
      const words = plainText.toLowerCase().split(/\s+/);
      const firstFemaleIndicator = words.find((word: string) => 
        femaleIndicators.includes(word)
      );

      if (firstFemaleIndicator) {
        return true;
      }
    }

    return false;

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error checking Wikipedia:', error);
    return false;
  }
}`}</CodeBlock>

The real magic happens in the gender verification logic: <Note number={7}>The gender verification system uses a combination of linguistic markers and context clues to determine if an article is about a woman.</Note>

This might seem simple, but it handles a surprising number of edge cases.

For example, it can handle:
- Modern articles using contemporary language ("businesswoman", "spokeswoman")
- Historical figures with period-appropriate descriptions
- Articles that use pronouns rather than explicit gender markers
- Stage names and mononyms through context clues

## MISSING MONONYMS!! ü¶ç

APE LOVE WHEN HUMANS HELP ADD MISSING MONONYMS!! (these are special names like "Madonna" or "Cher" that only have ONE NAME!!) here is how make pull request without complicated git stuff:

1. go to **[mononyms.json](https://github.com/DrBiznes/Name-100-Game/blob/main/src/lib/mononyms.json)** on github
2. click edit button (looks like tiny pencil)
3. add new amazing mononym like this:

```json
{
  "name": "Beyonc√©",
  "wikipedia": "/wiki/Beyonc√©"
}
```

4. scroll down, write message like "ADD QUEEN BEY TO LIST!!" 
5. click "Propose changes" 
6. click "Create pull request"

THAT ALL!! APE CHECK WIKIPEDIA LINK AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING GOOD!! <Note number={8}>APE NEED CHECK EACH NAME MANUALLY TO MAKE SURE IT WORK WITH VALIDATION SYSTEM!! APE SORRY FOR SLOW BUT APE WANT MAKE SURE EVERYTHING PERFECT!! üò¢</Note>

some tips to make APE happy:
- check if mononym already in list first
- make sure wikipedia link work
- only add real people or goddess (no fictional characters)
- format must match exactly like example above
- REMEMBER: ONLY ONE-NAME PEOPLE!! if person have first AND last name, they not go here!!

APE THANK YOU FOR HELPING MAKE GAME BETTER!! ü¶ç

## Tech Stack

This awesome game runs on GitHub Pages and Cloudflare's **SUPER STRONG WORKERS** and SQlite db!!!!!!!!! <Note number={9}>A "serverless" architecture means I don't maintain traditional servers - instead, the code runs automatically on Cloudflare's global infrastructure, as close to each player as possible.</Note>

### Frontend

The frontend is built with React. The UI builds on **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** components styled with **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**, while I used **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)** for animations. For interactive elements, I use **[react-confetti-explosion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-confetti-explosion)** to celebrate game completion, **[sonner](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/)** for toast notifications, and **[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)** for the interactive diagram. Core functionality relies on **[React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)** for server state and **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** for builds.

#### Typography

I'm using these awesome **[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)** I love you GoogleBot!!!!
- **Chonburi** ‚Üí primary headings and game title
